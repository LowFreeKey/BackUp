# hello-angular-motoko
This is an example of locally implementing the Internet Computer's motoko project along side Angular

---
&nbsp;
## Getting started

1. [Install DFX](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/local-quickstart.html). Please keep in mind the dfx cli currently only runs on Linux and Apple based PCs.
1. [Install Angular](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local)
1. Install npm packages from the project root: 
    `npm install`

    ### Serve Angular and the IC backend server locally with live reloading:
        
        npm run ng-start
        
    - Once the job fully starts, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.

    - If you make any changes while in development mode, the project will recompile on both the Angular and IC / Motoko side.

    ### Build and Serve the Angular application on the local IC server:

        npm run build-dfx-www

### package.json Scripts ( npm run [script name] )
| Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ng-start | Start the Angular and the IC server locally with live reloading |

### To learn more about working with dfx, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/quickstart-intro.html)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/sdk-guide.html)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/motoko.html)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/language-manual.html)
- [JavaScript API Reference](https://erxue-5aaaa-aaaab-qaagq-cai.raw.ic0.app)



Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 8000.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`NODE_ENV` to `production` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
